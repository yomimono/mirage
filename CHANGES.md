### 2.7.3 (2016-03-20)

* Fix another regression introduced in 2.7.1 which enable
  `-warn-error` by default. This is now controlled by a
  `--warn-error` flag on `mirage configure`. Currently it's
  default value is [false] but this might change in future
  versions (#520)

### 2.7.2 (2016-03-20)

* Fix regression introduced in 2.7.1 which truncates the ouput of
  `opam install` and breaks `opam depext` (#519, by @samoht)

### 2.7.1 (2016-03-17)

* Improve the Dockerfile (#507, by @avsm)
* Use Astring (by @samoht)
* Clean-up dependencies automatically added by the tool
  - do not require `lwt.syntax`, `cstruct.syntax` and `sexplib`, which
    should make the default unikernels camlp4-free (#510, #515 by @samoht)
  - always require `mirage-platform` (#512, by @talex5)
  - ensure that `mirage-types` and `mirage-types-lwt` are installed
* Turn on more warnings and enable "warning as errors".
* Check that the OCaml compiler is at least 4.02.3 (by @samoht)

### 2.7.0 (2016-02-17)

The mirage tool is now based on functoria. (#441 #450, by @drup @samoht)
See https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-functoria for full details.

* Command line interface: The config file must be passed with the -f option
  (instead of being just an argument).
* Two new generic combinators are available, generic_stack and generic_kv_ro.
* `get_mode` is deprecated. You should use keys instead. And in particular
  `Key.target` and `Key.is_xen`.
* `add_to_ocamlfind_libraries` and `add_to_opam_packages` are deprecated. Both
  the `foreign` and the `register` functions now accept the `~libraries` and
  `~packages` arguments to specify library dependencies.

* If you were using `tls` without the conduit combinator, you will be
  greeted during configuration by a message like this:
  ```
The "nocrypto" library is loaded but entropy is not enabled!
Please enable the entropy by adding a dependency to the nocrypto device.
You can do so by adding ~deps:[abstract nocrypto] to the arguments of Mirage.foreign.
  ```
  Data dependencies (such as entropy initialization) are now explicit.
  In order to fix this, you need to declare the dependency like so:
  ```ocaml
open Mirage

let my_functor =
  let deps = [abstract nocrypto] in
  foreign ~deps "My_Functor" (foo @-> bar)
  ```
  `My_functor.start` will now take an extra argument for each
  dependencies. In the case of nocrypto, this is `()`.

* Remove `nat-script.sh` from the scripts directory, to be available
  as an external script.

### 2.6.1 (2015-09-08)

* Xen: improve the .xl file generation. We now have
  - `name.xl`: this has sensible defaults for everything including the
    network bridges and should "just work" if used on the build box
  - `name.xl.in`: this has all the settings needed to boot (e.g. presence of
    block and network devices) but all the environmental dependencies are
    represented by easily-substitutable variables. This file is intended for
    production use: simply replace the variables for the paths, bridges, memory
    sizes etc. and run `xl create` as before.

### 2.6.0 (2015-07-28)

* Better ARP support. This needs `mirage-tcpip.2.6.0` (#419, by @yomimono)
  - [mirage-types] Remove `V1.IPV4.input_arp`
  - [mirage-types] Expose `V1.ARP` and `V1_LWT.ARP`
  - Expose a `Mirage.arp` combinator
* Provide noop configuration for default_time (#435, by @yomimono)
* Add `Mirage.archive` and `Mirage.archive_of_files` to support attaching files
  via a read-only tar-formatted BLOCK (#432, by @djs55)
* Add a .merlin file (#428, by @Drup)

### 2.5.1 (2015-07-17)

* [mirage-types] Expose `V1_LWT.FS.page_aligned_buffer = Cstruct.t`

### 2.5.0 (2015-06-10)

* Change the type of the `Mirage.http_server` combinator. The first argument
  (the conduit server configuration) is removed and should now be provided
  at compile-time in `unikernel.ml` instead of configuration-time in
  `config.ml`:

    ```ocaml
(* [config.ml] *)
(* in 2.4 *) let http = http_server (`TCP (`Port 80)) conduit
(* in 2.5 *) let http = http_server conduit

(* [unikernel.ml] *)
let start http =
(* in 2.4 *) http (S.make ~conn_closed ~callback ())
(* in 2.5 *) http (`TCP 80) (S.make ~conn_closed ~callback ())
    ```

* Change the type of the `Mirage.conduit_direct` combinator.
  Previously, it took an optional `vchan` implementation, an optional
  `tls` immplementation and an optional `stackv4` implemenation. Now,
  it simply takes a `stackv4` implementation and a boolean to enable
  or disable the `tls` stack. Users who want to continue to use
  `vchan` with `conduit` should now use the `Vchan` functors inside
  `unikernel.ml` instead of the combinators in `config.ml`. To
  enable the TLS stack:

    ```ocaml
(* [config.ml] *)
let conduit = conduit_direct ~tls:true (stack default_console)

(* [unikernel.ml] *)
module Main (C: Conduit_mirage.S): struct
  let start conduit =
    C.listen conduit (`TLS (tls_config, `TCP 443)) callback
end
    ```

* [types] Remove `V1.ENTROPY` and `V1_LWT.ENTROPY`. The entropy is now
  handled directly by `nocrypto.0.4.0` and the mirage-tool is only responsible to
  call the `Nocrypto_entropy_{mode}.initialize` function.

* Remove `Mirage.vchan`, `Mirage.vchan_localhost`, `Mirage.vchan_xen` and
  `Mirage.vchan_default`. Vchan users need to adapt their code to directly
  use the `Vchan` functors instead of relying on the combinators.
* Remove `Mirage.conduit_client` and `Mirage.conduit_server` types.
* Fix misleading "Compiling for target" messages in `mirage build`
  (#408 by @lnmx)
* Add `--no-depext` to disable the automatic installation of opam depexts (#402)
* Support `@name/file` findlib's extended name syntax in `xen_linkopts` fields.
  `@name` is expanded to `%{lib}%/name`
* Modernize the Travis CI scripts

### 2.4.0 (2015-05-05)

* Support `mirage-http.2.2.0`
* Support `conduit.0.8.0`
* Support `tcpip.2.4.0`
* Add time and clock parameters to IPv4 (#362, patch from @yomimono)
* Support for `ocaml-tls` 0.4.0.
* Conduit now takes an optional TLS argument, allowing servers to support
  encryption. (#347)
* Add the ability to specify `Makefile.user` to extend the generated
  `Makefile`. Also `all`, `build` and `clean` are now extensible make
  targets.
* Remove the `mirage run` command (#379)
* Call `opam depext` when configuring (#373)
* Add opam files for `mirage` and `mirage-types` packages
* Fix `mirage --version` (#374)
* Add a `update-doc` target to the Makefile to easily update the online
  documentation at http://mirage.github.io/mirage/

### 2.3.0 (2015-03-10)

* Remove the `IO_PAGE` module type from `V1`. This has now moved into the
  `io-page` pacakge (#356)
* Remove `DEVICE.connect` from the `V1` module types.  When a module is
  functorised over a `DEVICE` it should only have the ability to
  *use* devices it is given, not to connect to new ones. (#150)
* Add `FLOW.error_message` to the `V1` module types to allow for
  generic handling of errors. (#346)
* Add `IP.uipaddr` as a universal IP address type. (#361)
* Support the `entropy` version 0.2+ interfaces. (#359)
* Check that the `opam` command is at least version 1.2.0 (#355)
* Don't put '-classic-display' in the generated Makefiles. (#364)

### 2.2.1 (2015-01-29)

* Fix logging errors when `mirage` output is not redirected. (#355)
* Do not reverse the order of C libraries when linking.  This fixes Zarith
  linking in Xen mode. (#341).
* Fix typos in command line help. (#352).

### 2.2.0 (2014-12-18)

* Add IPv6 support. This alters some of the interfaces that were previously
  hardcoded to IPv4 by generalising them.  For example:

    ```ocaml
type v4
type v6

type 'a ip
type ipv4 = v4 ip
type ipv6 = v6 ip
    ```

Full support for configuring IPv6 does not exist yet, as this release is
intended for getting the type definitions in place before adding configuration
support.

### 2.1.1 (2014-12-10)

* Do not reuse the Unix linker options when building Xen unikernels.  Instead,
  get the linker options from the ocamlfind `xen_linkopts` variables (#332).
  See `tcpip.2.1.0` for a library that does this for a C binding.
* Only activate MacOS X compilation by default on 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.
  Older revisions of MacOS X will use the generic Unix mode by default, since
  the `vmnet` framework requires Yosemite or higher.
* Do not run crunched filesystem modules through `camlp4`, which significantly
  speeds up compilation on ARM platforms (from minutes to seconds!) (#299).

### 2.1.0 (2014-12-07)

* Add specific support for `MacOSX` as a platform, which enables network bridging
  on Yosemite (#329).  The `--unix` flag will automatically activate the new target
  if run on a MacOS X host.  If this breaks for you due to being on an older version of
  MacOS X, then use the new `--target` flag to set either Unix, MacOSX or Xen to the
  `mirage configure` command.
* Add `mirage.runtime` findlib library and corresponding Mirage_runtime module (#327).
* If net driver in STACKV4_direct can't initialize, print a helpful error (#164).
* [xen]: fixed link order in generated Makefile (#322).
* Make `Lwt.tracing` instructions work for Fish shell too by improving quoting (#328).

### 2.0.1 (2014-11-21)

* Add `register ~tracing` to enable tracing with mirage-profile at start-up (#321).
* Update Dockerfile for latest libraries (#320).
* Only build mirage-types if Io_page is also installed (#324).

### 2.0.0 (2014-11-05)

* [types]: backwards incompatible change: CONSOLE is now a FLOW;
  'write' has a different signature and 'write_all' has been removed.
* Set on_crash = 'preserve' in default Xen config.
* Automatically install dependencies again, but display the live output to the
  user.
* Include C stub libraries in linker command when generating Makefiles for Xen.
* Add `Vchan`, `Conduit` and `Resolver` code generators.
* Generate a `*.xe` script which can upload a kernel to a XenServer.
* Generate a libvirt `*.xml` configuration file (#292).
* Fix determination of `mirage-xen` location for paths with spaces (#279).
* Correctly show config file locations when using a custom one.
* Fix generation of foreign (non-functor) modules (#293)

### 1.2.0 (2014-07-05)

The Mirage frontend tool now generates a Makefile with a `make depend`
target, instead of directly invoking OPAM as part of `mirage configure`.
This greatly improves usability on slow platforms such as ARM, since the
output of OPAM as it builds can be inspected more easily.  Users will now
need to run `make depend` to ensure they have the latest package set,
before building their unikernel with `make` as normal.

* Improve format of generated Makefile, and also colours in terminal output.
* Add `make depend` target to generated Makefile.
* Set `OPAMVERBOSE` and `OPAMYES` in the Makefile, which can be overridden.
* Add an `ENTROPY` device type for strong random sources (#256).

### 1.1.3 (2014-06-15)

* Build OPAM packages in verbose mode by default.
* [types] Add `FLOW` based on `TCPV4`.
* travis: build mirage-types from here, rather than 1.1.0.

### 1.1.2 (2014-04-01)

* Improvement to the Amazon EC2 deployment script.
* [types] Augment STACKV4 with an IPV4 module in addition to TCPV4 and UDPV4.
* Regenerate with OASIS 0.4.4 (which adds natdynlink support)

### 1.1.1 (2014-02-21)

* Man page fixes for typos and terminology (#220).
* Activate backtrace recording by default (#225).
* Fixes in the `V1.STACKV4` to expose UDPv4/TCPv4 types properly (#226).

### 1.1.0 (2014-02-05)

* Add a combinator interface to device binding that makes the functor generation
  significantly more succinct and expressive.  This breaks backwards compatibility
  with `config.ml` files from the 1.0.x branches.
* Integrate the `mirage-types` code into `types`.  This is built as a separate
  library from the command-line tool, via the `install-types` Makefile target.

### 1.0.4 (2014-01-14)

* Add default build tags for annot, bin_annot, principal and strict_sequence.
* Renane `KV_RO` to `Crunch`

### 1.0.3 (2013-12-18)

* Do not remove OPAM packages when doing `mirage clean` (#143)
* [xen] generate a simple main.xl, without block devices or network interfaces.
* The HTTP dependency now also installs `mirage-tcp-*` and `mirage-http-*`.
* Fix generated Makefile dependency on source OCaml files to rebuild reliably.
* Support `Fat_KV_RO` (a read-only k/v version of the FAT filesystem).
* The Unix `KV_RO` now passes through to the underlying filesystem instead of calling `crunch`, via `mirage-fs-unix`.

### 1.0.2 (2013-12-10)

* Add `HTTP` support.
* Fix `KV_RO` configuration for OPAM autoinstall.

### 1.0.1 (2013-12-09)

* Add more examples to the FAT filesystem test case.
* Fix `mirage-tcpip-*` support
* Fix `mirage-net-*` support

### 1.0.0 (2013-12-09)

* Adapt the latest library releases for Mirage 1.0 interfaces.

### 0.10.0 (2013-12.08)

* Complete API rewrite
* [xen] XL configuration phase is now created during configure phase, was during run phase.

### 0.9.7 (2013-08-09)

* Generate code that uses the `Ipaddr.V4` interface instead of `Nettypes`.

### 0.9.6 (2013-07-26)

* fix unix-direct by linking the unix package correctly (previously it was always dropped).

### 0.9.5 (2013-07-18)

* completely remove the dependency on obuild: use ocamlbuild everywhere now.
* adapt for mirage-0.9.3 OS.Netif interfaces (abstract type `id`).
* do not output network config when there are no `ip-*` lines in the `.conf` file.
* do not try to install `mirage-fs` if there is no filesystem to create.
* added `nat-script.sh` to setup xenbr0 with DNS, DHCP and masqerading under Linux.

### 0.9.4 (2013-07-09)

* build using ocamlbuild rather than depending on obuild.
* [xen] generate a symbol that can be used to produce stack traces with xenctx.
* mirari run --socket just runs the unikernel without any tuntap work.
* mirari run --xen creates a xl config file and runs `xl create -c unikernel.xl`.

### 0.9.3 (2013-06-12)

* Add a `--socket` flag to activate socket-based networking (UNIX only).
* Do not use OPAM compiler switches any more, as that's done in the packaging now.
* Use fd-passing in the UNIX backend to spawn a process.

### 0.9.2 (2013-03-28)

* Install `obuild` automatically in all compiler switches (such as Xen).
* Only create symlinks to `mir-foo` for a non-Xen target.
* Add a `mirari clean` command.
* Add the autoswitch feature via `mirari --switch=<compiler>` or the config file.

### 0.9.1 (2013-02-13)

* Fix Xen symlink upon build.
* Add a `--no-install` option to `mirari configure` to prevent invoking OPAM automatically.

### 0.9.0 (2013-02-12)

* Automatically install `mirage-fs` package if a filesystem crunch is requested.
* Remove the need for `mir-run` by including the final Xen link directly in Mirari.
* Add support for building Xen variants.
* Initial import of a unix-direct version.
